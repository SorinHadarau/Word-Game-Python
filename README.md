# Word-Game-Python

These are the requirements that I still have to refine, test, and eventually modify in my code.
(Please keep in mind that above code snippet is just an example and it might need slight adjustments depending on the way you implement and utilize libraries such as PyDictionary.

You are provided with a word of eight letters or more which we'll call the "sourceword".

You are to think up seven 4-or-more letter words made up from the letters contained within the sourceword, ensuring that:

Each word is only made up from the letters contained within the sourceword.
You haven't reused any letter more times that it appears in the sourceword.
Each word exists within the dictionary (i.e., it's a “real” word).
The words all have four letters or more.
There are no duplicate words.
None of the seven words is the source word.
Note: case is NOT significiant (i.e., This, THIS, and this are the *same* word).
